# Clone of py-kaldi-asr

This is a clone from https://github.com/gooofy/py-kaldi-asr

Main changes done in this clone:
- Modify setup.py to search for package `blas` instead of `atlas`.  Because in new version of Ubuntu, after `sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev`, the package installed in pkg-config is `blas` and `blas-atlas`.
- Change some of to codes to be compatible with Python 3.  E.g., change `asr_server.py` to use Flask instead of BaseHTTPServer.
- Added docker files to build the image and container using the official Kaldi image (version 5.5) as base. There is an existing docker image at `quay.io/mpuels/docker-py-kaldi-asr`, but it is based on older Kaldi version which does not support factorized model.

If you just want to run it in docker instead of compiling on your local:
1. `cd docker`
2. Modify `docker-compose.yml`, in the volumes section, point the local path to your actual model directory.  Assuming your have downloaded the pre-trained model following the original README below.
3. Run `docker-compose build` to build the image.
4. Run `docker-compose up` to run the container.
If everything is successful, the web service should be running on http://localhost:8301 .
Use the script examples/asr_client.py to test it.

Below is the README from the original repo.

# py-kaldi-asr

Some simple wrappers around kaldi-asr intended to make using kaldi's online nnet3-chain
decoders as convenient as possible. Kaldi's online GMM decoders are also supported.

Target audience are developers who would like to use kaldi-asr as-is for speech
recognition in their application on GNU/Linux operating systems.

Constructive comments, patches and pull-requests are very welcome.

Getting Started
===============

We recommend using pre-trained modules from the [zamia-speech](http://zamia-speech.org/) project
to get started. There you will also find a tutorial complete with links to pre-built binary packages
to get you up and running with free and open source speech recognition in a matter of minutes:

[Zamia Speech Tutorial](https://github.com/gooofy/zamia-speech#get-started-with-our-pre-trained-models)

Example Code
------------

Simple wav file decoding:

```python
from kaldiasr.nnet3 import KaldiNNet3OnlineModel, KaldiNNet3OnlineDecoder

MODELDIR    = 'data/models/kaldi-generic-en-tdnn_sp-latest'
WAVFILE     = 'data/dw961.wav'

kaldi_model = KaldiNNet3OnlineModel (MODELDIR)
decoder     = KaldiNNet3OnlineDecoder (kaldi_model)

if decoder.decode_wav_file(WAVFILE):

    s, l = decoder.get_decoded_string()

    print
    print u"*****************************************************************"
    print u"**", WAVFILE
    print u"**", s
    print u"** %s likelihood:" % MODELDIR, l
    print u"*****************************************************************"
    print

else:

    print "***ERROR: decoding of %s failed." % WAVFILE
```

Please check the examples directory for more example code.

Requirements
============

* Python 2.7 or 3.5
* NumPy
* Cython
* [kaldi-asr](http://kaldi-asr.org/ "kaldi-asr.org")

Setup Notes
===========

Source
------

At the time of this writing kaldi-asr does not seem to have an official way to
install it on a system. 

So, for now we will rely on pkg-config to provide LIBS and CFLAGS for compilation:
Create a file called `kaldi-asr.pc` somewhere in your `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` that provides
this information - here is what such a file could look like (details depend on your OS environment):

```bash
kaldi_root=/opt/kaldi

Name: kaldi-asr
Description: kaldi-asr speech recognition toolkit
Version: 5.2
#Requires: atlas
Libs: -L${kaldi_root}/tools/openfst/lib -L${kaldi_root}/src/lib -lkaldi-decoder -lkaldi-lat -lkaldi-fstext -lkaldi-hmm -lkaldi-feat -lkaldi-transform -lkaldi-gmm -lkaldi-tree -lkaldi-util -lkaldi-matrix -lkaldi-base -lkaldi-nnet3 -lkaldi-online2 -lkaldi-cudamatrix -lkaldi-ivector -lfst
Cflags: -I${kaldi_root}/src  -I${kaldi_root}/tools/openfst/include
```

make sure `kaldi_root` points to wherever your kaldi checkout lives in your filesystem.

__Note__: [Haijie] Since current version of `libatlas-base-dev` install package `blas` instead of `atlas`, need to remove the dependency of atlas from kaldi-asr.pc.

ATLAS
-----

You may need to install ATLAS headers even if you didn't need them to compile Kaldi.

```
$ sudo apt install libatlas-dev
```
